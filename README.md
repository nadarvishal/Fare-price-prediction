# Fare-price-prediction
OBJECTIVE:
The objective is to first find the hidden information in the dataset corresponding to correlation on the dataset so that we can know the effect of price with every field in the dataset. Later, we work with several machine learning models and compare each other to find the best one based on the accuracy, after this the best model is performed for further predictions of the ‘price’ label.
The outcome of this project will be company can find the price surge at a particular conditions like temperature, rainfall, distance, time, location, etc., Our objective i.e. finding the ‘price’ label at that conditions, will address the problem of finding the price surge at any odd conditions.

Dataset is take from Kaggle:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma

Included weather conditions in the calculation of the cost of cab rides. Studied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and removed duplicate and null values to create a dataset for processing. Implemented different ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes, random forest, and logistic regression to compare and design the best model to predict the price of the cab ride using different features such as weather, visibility, temperature, surge multiplier, and more.
Achieved a model with 95 percent accuracy to predict the correct price of the cab ride.
