# Fare-price-prediction
OBJECTIVE:
The objective is to first find the hidden information in the dataset corresponding to correlation on the dataset so that we can know the effect of price with every field in the dataset. Later, we work with several machine learning models and compare each other to find the best one based on the accuracy, after this the best model is performed for further predictions of the ‘price’ label.
The outcome of this project will be company can find the price surge at a particular conditions like temperature, rainfall, distance, time, location, etc., Our objective i.e. finding the ‘price’ label at that conditions, will address the problem of finding the price surge at any odd conditions.

Dataset is take from Kaggle:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma
